For 30% of trials, an auditory stop signal was presented (i.e., two hundred and fifty-two trials did not include the auditory stop signal, and 108 included the auditory stop signal). The auditory stop signal was 100 ms (1 kHz) in duration and was matched with the visual stimulus with a variable delay (0–50 ms) that adapted to the participant’s behavioral performance. Each block had the same percentage of the auditory stop signal. Each trial began with a fixation point (+) that was displayed for 2000 ms, followed by the letter X or O appearing for 2000 ms. X and O had an equal frequency of occurrence.","Instructions":"Participants were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible when the auditory stop signal was not present “go” condition and withhold their response when the stop signal appeared “no-go” condition","SamplingFrequency":500,"Manufacturer":"Geodesic EEG system","ManufacturersModelName":"Geodesic Net Amps 300, Netstation 4.5.2 software","CapManufacturer":"Geodesic EEG systems","CapManufacturersModelName":"128-channel Geodesic Hydrocell Sensor Net™","EEGChannelCount":128,"EOGChannelCount":0,"ECGChannelCount":0,"EMGChannelCount":0,"MiscChannelCount":4,"PowerLineFrequency":100,"EEGPlacementScheme":"10 percent system","EEGReference":"128","EEGGround":"Cz","SoftwareFilters":"n/a","RecordingType":"continuous"}
